Describe your development and deployment workflow in enough detail that a new team member or someone taking over the project could follow to successfully test and deploy theme updates to your staging and live sites. This should include issues/processes such as project management, version control, testing and automation. Do not provide private details like passwords.

The Deployment and web development was to push changes from one deployment environment to another.
Our website used the remote host known as Site Ground which provided local development as well as staging production. 
Since everything was on Site ground it would be straightforward for anyone who wants to do testing and deploying themes. 

So, we developed a site installing WordPress in our hosting site that was site ground. We used a nice page plugin to develop our site. For that we downloaded a nice page plugin online and installed it in our WordPress (CMS technology to build site) by uploading the plugin. We created pages and linked them making menus using nice page editor in WordPress. We used elements and blocks available in the plugin. It was easy to use the nice page plugin it allowed us to simply add a block and add contents to it. We can just view page and click on edit with nice page to edit our site. 
Regarding how we made our site live, we hosted it in site ground where we had installed wordpress.org so all we had to do was save and upload our pages and the site would publish the changes. Site ground seems to be very friendly hosting site as we could simply host our website by turning our pages into posts in WordPress.

For project management, our team used several different platfroms. We used Trello to keep track of our activities. We used Whatsapp for communication and GitHub for documentation.
