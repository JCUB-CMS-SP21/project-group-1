This page should help a new developer to continue developing your theme. Include relevant information about what features your theme has, files that would need editing, design decisions, colours, etc. You do not need to produce a serious design document or reproduce basic details about WordPress theme development, only what is specific to your theme.

For creating the website, we used Nice Page plugin. The theme was designed eaisly using the theme feature for Nice Page plugin. The header and footer were designed to look the same for each page. In terms of the content for each page, they were done by selecting the blocks and changing their individual design to suit our needs. The text size and weight for all pages was by default set to 16px ad 400 respectively in the themes setting. The logo was designed seperately and placed on the top left of the header. Most of the content would have to be edited accordingly since it was all made from scratch and not directly given by the employer.
Below are images of our themes. Changing the theme would not be challanging. You can change font style, size and weight as well as colours very eaisly in the theme window of the Nice page.
