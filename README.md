A Brief description of project:

You will work in a team of 4 people to develop and deploy one website using WordPress for a client. Project management and "devops" are key aspects of this assignment. Your site must be designed using your own custom theme that you develop based on an appropriate "starter theme". As described in the details below, your group must create, test and document an appropriate modern collaborative development and deployment workflow for this project.
You should perform all the standard design steps like information architecture, interface design and information design. All design decisions are up to you except for anything specified as a requirement by the client. Your design should be appropriate for your client's goals and target audience.
