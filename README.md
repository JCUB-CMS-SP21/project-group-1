This is the Content Management Systems project by group 1.

A Brief description of project:

We worked in a team of 4 people to develop and deploy one website using WordPress for a client(Pringles Tech Limited). Project management and "devops" are key aspects of this assignment. Our website was designed using your own custom theme that we develop based on an appropriate "starter theme" and then continued to edit it using NicePage plugin. We created and tested the website using NicePage which also allowed version control for the site. We deployed the website on site ground and documented the whole collaborative development and deployment workflow for this project.
By performing all the standard design steps like information architecture, interface design and information design, we tried to create an appropriate design meeting the client's goals and target audience.
